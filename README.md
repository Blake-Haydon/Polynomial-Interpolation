# Polynomial Interpolation

Contains implementations for the [Lagrange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_polynomial) and [Newton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_polynomial) polynomial interpolation methods. These notebooks are were used for my own learning and are not intended to be a complete reference.
