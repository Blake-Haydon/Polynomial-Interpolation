    "# Fast Interpolation for $n$ elements\n",

    "**Findings**:\n",
    "- The inverse Vandermonde matrix preserves the same structure as the original Vandermonde matrix. This is because the original Vandermonde matrix is a Hermitian matrix.\n",
    "- There is a one-to-one mapping between elements in the original Vandermonde matrix and the inverse Vandermonde matrix.\n",
    "  - **IMPORTANT**: I believe that this will allow for efficient computation of the inverse Vandermonde matrix as we only need to find a one-to-one map of $n$ values.\n",
